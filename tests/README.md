# Testing

## Running tests

- Install pytest: `pip install pytest`
- Run `pytest`

# Test Files

Sample files are provided in the test_files folder.  The python script `make_test_docs.py` generates the docx files for the .docx plugin.  You won't need to do this unless you need to update the test documents' metadata.
